    # Overriding default CMD to use dev server for hot reload. 
    # Note: original Dockerfile uses 'node dist/main.js' which is prod.
    # For this to work efficiently, we might need a dev target in Dockerfile, 
    # but 'npm run start:dev' should work if dependencies are installed.
    # Since we are mounting src, we need to ensure node_modules inside container are preserved.
